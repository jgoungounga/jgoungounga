[Juste GOUNGOUNGA](https://jgoungounga.github.io/) is an Associate Professor of Biostatistics and Health Data Science at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sant√© Publique ( EHESP) and a researcher at the ARENES Laboratory (UMR CNRS 6051), affiliated with the INSERM U1309 team on ‚ÄúResearch on Health Services and Management in Health‚Äù (RSMS). He has held this position since October 2022.

At EHESP, Dr. GOUNGOUNGA teaches courses on various topics, including French hospital discharge databases ( PMSI), and supervises students. He is also a member of the CENSUR working survival group. His research specializes in statistical methods for epidemiology, particularly non-communicable diseases like cancer, with a focus on identifying and quantifying health inequalities.

He received his medical degree from the University of Ouagadougou in 2012 and transitioned from clinical practice to biostatistics. He completed a Master‚Äôs in Public Health, specializing in quantitative and econometric methods for health research, and a Ph.D. in Clinical Research and Public Health with a focus on biostatistics from the University of Aix-Marseille in 2018. His Ph.D. thesis contributed to the extension of relative survival methods in the field of clinical research. While with the Joint Research Unit 1252 SESSTIM (Inserm / IRD / Aix Marseille Universit√©), Dr. GOUNGOUNGA developed the xhaz R package for excess hazard modeling with inappropriate mortality rates. In January 2020, he joined the Burgundy Digestive Cancer Registry/University of Burgundy ( EPICAD team - UMR 1231) as a postdoctoral researcher, supported by the ARC Foundation for Cancer Research. His postdoctoral research focused on estimating time-to-cure for cancer patients, considering disparities in credit and insurance access.

His current research explores inequalities in cancer risk and mortality according to smoking status in patients with chronic kidney disease. Here is a link to my updated list of publications: [Updated Publications LIST](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=7h30AYwAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao).
